This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Description

This repository is a personal project dedicated to showcasing the web applications I've created for my girlfriend. I found it more convenient to host them here on GitHub for easy access and sharing.

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
