## About this project

This repository is a personal project dedicated to showcasing the web applications I've created for my girlfriend. I found it more convenient to host them here on GitHub for easy access and sharing.

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project is hosted on both Vercel and GitHub Pages (See `gh-pages` branch for the deployment setup).

Before deploying to GitHub Pages, you'll need to run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. Prepare the project for deployment:
npm run predeploy

# 2. Build the project
npm run build
```
